                <h3>Eminem's most famous songs</h3>
                <p>Eminem's first song to enter the Billboard Hot 100 was "My Name Is", which was released in 1999 and
                    became
                    the
                    most successful single from The Slim Shady LP. It and "Guilty Conscience" both reached the top 5 in
                    the
                    UK.
                    <br>
                    The lead single from Eminem's third studio album, The Marshall Mathers LP, was the song "The Real
                    Slim
                    Shady",
                    which became his first entry in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. The third single from the
                    album,
                    "Stan",
                    featured vocals from British singer Dido, sampled from her song "Thank You". "Stan" was the album's
                    most
                    successful single outside of the States, while it failed to reach the top 50 in Eminem's home
                    country.
                    <br>
                    In 2002, Eminem released the singles "Without Me" and "Cleanin' Out My Closet" from his album The
                    Eminem
                    Show,
                    as well as the single "Lose Yourself" from the 8 Mile soundtrack, which became his first number one
                    song
                    on
                    the
                    Hot 100 and remained on the top for 12 weeks. The song also reached the top of various national
                    charts
                    worldwide.
                    <br>
                    In 2009, the song "Crack a Bottle", a collaboration with label-mates Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, became
                    Eminem's
                    second
                    number one on the Hot 100 and broke the record for opening week download sales in the US, with
                    418,000
                    copies
                    sold in the first week.
                    <br>
                    Recovery's singles "Not Afraid" and "Love the Way You Lie" featuring Rihanna, both released in 2010,
                    became
                    Eminem's third and fourth number one songs on the Hot 100; the latter also reached the top of
                    various
                    national
                    charts worldwide. In June 2014, his song "Not Afraid" was diamond certified by the RIAA, thus making
                    Eminem
                    the
                    first artist with two digital diamond awards by RIAA.
                    <br>
                    In August 2013, Eminem released the single "Berzerk" which debuted number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100
                    and
                    preceded his eighth studio album The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The album spawned the singles
                    "Survival",
                    which
                    was
                    showcased during the Call of Duty: Ghosts reveal trailer, "Rap God", and "The Monster" featuring
                    Rihanna.
                    "The Monster" became Eminem's fifth No. 1 single on the Hot 100, tying him with rappers Ludacris and
                    P.
                    Diddy
                    for rappers with the most No. 1 singles in the US. In May 2014, Eminem was announced as the
                    most-streamed
                    artist
                    of all time on Spotify.
                    <br>
                    From 2017 to 2020, Eminem released various hit singles, including "River" featuring Ed Sheeran,
                    "Lucky
                    You"
                    featuring Joyner Lucas, "Killshot", and "Godzilla" featuring Juice Wrld. The latter two debuted at
                    number 3
                    on
                    the Billboard Hot 100.

                <h3>Eminem's acting career</h3>

                <p>After small roles in the 2001 film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for "Got the
                    Life"
                    (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the
                    semi-autobiographical
                    2002
                    film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his
                    life. He
                    recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including "Lose Yourself".

                    <br>Eminem voiced an aging, corrupt, Ebonics-speaking police officer in the video game 50 Cent:
                    Bulletproof
                    and
                    guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show.
                    He
                    was
                    signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun - Will Travel, and was considered for the role
                    of
                    David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper. Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the
                    2009
                    film Funny People. In a 2010 interview with Jonathan Ross, he stated "You know, I love music so
                    much.
                    This
                    is my
                    passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I won't do a movie ever again, but this is me.

                    <br>He played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale "Lose Yourself" with Christina Aguilera.
                    Although
                    Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because
                    director
                    Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit. Eminem had a cameo
                    appearance
                    as
                    himself in the 2014 film The Interview.
